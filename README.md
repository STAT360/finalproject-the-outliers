PROPOSAL:

   Our group intends on making an analysis package for our final project. We want to analyze data about surgeries in the United States. We might look to see what states are the most/least costly for surgeries based on our dataset, or what specific hospitals or cities have the most expensive procedures. We will look for patterns and try to answer some of these questions. We found a dataset on medicare.gov that we are starting with, and will look to other government resources if needed. We also found a reddit post that provided some helpful links on finding data on surgeries in the US that we can use.
